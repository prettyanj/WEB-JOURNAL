    <h2>What is Nanotechnology?</h2>
    <p class="indent">
      Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on a near-atomic scale to
      produce new structures, materials and devices. The technology promises
      scientific advancement in many sectors such as medicine, consumer
      products, energy, materials and manufacturing.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the
      nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers. Physicist Richard Feynman,
      the father of nanotechnology. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are the study
      and application of extremely small things and can be used across all the
      other science fields, such as chemistry, biology, physics, materials
      science, and engineering.
    </p>
    <h2>How it started</h2>
    <p class="indent">
      The term "nanotechnology" was not coined until 1974 by researcher Norio
      Taniguchi, who used it to describe precision machining at the
      nanoscale.The concept of nanotechnology, the study and manipulation of
      matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale, can be traced
      back to a talk given by physicist Richard Feynman in 1959. He discussed
      the possibility of manipulating and arranging individual atoms and
      molecules to create new materials and devices.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      In the 1980s, the development of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
      and the atomic force microscope (AFM) allowed scientists to visualize and
      manipulate individual atoms and molecules, opening up new possibilities
      for nanoscale research.

    <h3>Some of the ways in which nanotechnology is being used:</h3>
    <ul></ul>
      <li><b>Improved material properties:</b> Nanoscale materials can have
      different and improved properties compared to their bulk counterparts,
      such as increased strength, improved electrical conductivity, and enhanced
      optical properties.</li>

    <li><b>Enhanced energy production and storage:</b> Nanotechnology is being
      used to develop more efficient and cost-effective ways to produce and
      store energy, such as improved batteries and solar cells.</li>

    <li><b>Improved medical diagnosis and treatment:</b> Nanotechnology is being
      used to develop new diagnostic tools and drug delivery systems, allowing
      for more targeted and effective treatments of diseases.</li>

    <li><b>Improved environmental remediation:</b> Nanotechnology is being used to
      develop new methods for cleaning up pollution and waste, such as using
      nanoscale materials to remove contaminants from water and soil.</li>

    <li><b>Increased computing power:</b> Nanotechnology is being used to develop
      smaller and more efficient electronic components, allowing for increased
      computing power and reduced energy consumption.</li>

    <li><b>New materials and devices:</b> Nanotechnology is being used to create
      new materials and devices that were not previously possible, such as
      nanoscale sensors, nanorobots, and nanoscale circuits.</li>
    </ul>
