    <h1>What is Cloud Computing?</h1>
    <p class="indent">Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computing resources such as servers, storage, and software applications over the internet, without the need to maintain their own hardware or infrastructure. It is a model for delivering computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, over the internet. </p>
    <p>Cloud computing is typically classified into three types of services:</p>
    <p><b>1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</b>: This includes the provision of virtualized computing resources such as storage, networking, and processing power.<br>

      <b>2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)</b>: This includes the provision of a complete platform for developing, testing, and deploying software applications.<br>
      
      <b>3. Software as a Service (SaaS)</b>: This includes the provision of software applications that can be accessed over the internet, usually on a subscription basis.<br></p>
      
      <h1>What is Quantum Computing?</h1>
      <p class="indent">Quantum cloud computing makes quantum computing resources available to organizations, academics and other users through cloud technology. Cloud-based quantum computers function at greater speeds, with higher computing power than conventional computers, because they employ the principles of quantum physics when solving complex computational problems.</p>
      <p class="indent">Different types of quantum computers exist, such as quantum annealers, analog quantum simulators and universal quantum computers. Quantum annealers are considered the least powerful among quantum computers but work well to solve optimization problems. Analog quantum simulators, on the other hand, are powerful systems that can solve physics and biochemistry problems. Universal quantum computers are the most powerful and widely used type of quantum computer. They are also the most difficult to build. Universal computing can potentially access up to 1 million qubits (basic units of quantum information). However, the current technology can only access around 100 to 400 qubits.</p>
      <h2>What is the difference of Cloud and Quantum Computing?</h2>
      <p class="indent">Quantum cloud computing employs quantum principles to distributed computing, while cloud computing uses remote servers to provide distributed computing services. Cloud computing simply refers to providing services such as data storage, servers, databases and networking via the internet. Instead of storing data on physical servers onsite, for example, an organization can opt for cloud storage services to cut hardware maintenance and other costs.</p>
      <p class="indent">Quantum cloud computing, on the other hand, derives from quantum computing — a form of computing that uses quantum mechanics principles to solve complex problems. It provides quantum computers for users to access quantum-enabled services and solutions through the cloud. Companies using cloud computing, such as Google, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft, are also at the forefront of developing quantum computers to refine computing technology and enable more users to access quantum computers through the cloud. IBM’s Osprey quantum computer, for example, features 433 qubits. The company reportedly plans to scale up to 4,000 qubits by 2025.
