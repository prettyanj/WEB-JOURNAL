    <h2>What is Computer Vision?</h2>
    <p class="indent">
      Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with enabling
      computers to interpret and analyze images and videos in the same way that
      humans do. It involves the use of various techniques and algorithms to
      extract meaningful information from digital images and videos.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the goal of computer vision?</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      To create machines that can understand visual information and make
      decisions based on that information. This includes tasks such as image and
      video recognition, object detection and tracking, facial recognition, and
      even autonomous driving.
    </p>
    <h3>How computer vision works?</h3>
    <p>
      <b>1. Acquiring an image:</b> Images, even large sets, can be acquired in
      real-time through video, photos or 3D technology for analysis.<br />
      <b>2. Processing the image:</b> Deep learning models automate much of this
      process, but the models are often trained by first being fed thousands of
      labeled or pre-identified images.<br />
      <b>3. Understanding the image:</b> The final step is the interpretative
      step, where an object is identified or classified.<br />
    </p>

    <h2>What is Cyber Security?</h2>
    <p class="indent">
      It is the protection of computer systems from the theft of or damage to
      their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the
      disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are some security measures to be taken to prevent
      cybercrimes:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>➢ Staff awareness training</b> - Human error is the leading cause of
      data breaches, so you need to equip staff with the knowledge to deal with
      the threats they face. Training courses will show staff how security
      threats affect them and help them apply best-practice advice to real-world
      situations.<br />
      <b>➢ Application security</b> - Web application vulnerabilities are a
      common point of intrusion for cybercriminals. As applications play an
      increasingly critical role in business, it is vital to focus on web
      application security.<br />
      <b>➢ Network security</b> - Network security is the process of protecting
      the usability and integrity of your network and data. This is achieved by
      conducting a network penetration test, which scans your network for
      vulnerabilities and security issues.<br />
      <b>➢ Leadership commitment</b> - Leadership commitment is the key to cyber
      resilience. Without it, it is very difficult to establish or enforce
      effective processes. Top management must be prepared to invest in
      appropriate cybersecurity resources, such as awareness training.<br />
      <b>➢ Password management</b> - Almost half of the UK population uses
      ‘password’, ‘123456’ or ‘qwerty’ as their password. You should implement a
      password management policy that provides guidance to ensure staff create
      strong passwords and keep them secure. 7.8.3. Types of cybersecurity
      threats<br />
      <b>➢ Ransomware</b> - It is a type of malicious software. It is designed
      to extort money by blocking access to files or the computer system until
      the ransom is paid. Paying the ransom does not guarantee that the files
      will be recovered or the system restored.<br />
