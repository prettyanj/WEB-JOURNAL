    <h2>What is Data Science</h2>
    <p class="indent">
      Data science is an interdisciplinary field that involves using statistical
      and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data. It
      encompasses various techniques, including data analysis, machine learning,
      and data visualization, to extract meaningful information and insights
      from complex and large datasets.
    </p>
    <h2>Why is data science important?</h2>
    <p class="indent">
      It extract valuable insights and knowledge from this data that can be used
      to improve decision-making, drive innovation, and solve complex problems
      in various fields. By applying statistical and computational methods to
      analyze and interpret data, data scientists can identify patterns, trends,
      and correlations that can help us make predictions about future outcomes.
      Additionally, data science is crucial for developing intelligent machines
      and algorithms, which can automate tasks and improve efficiency in various
      industries. Overall, data science has become an essential tool for
      businesses, researchers, and policymakers to make informed decisions and
      create positive impact in society.
