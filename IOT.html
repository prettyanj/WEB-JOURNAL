    <h1>What is IOT?</h1>
    <p class="indent">
      (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with
      electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables
      these objects to collect and exchange data. IoT is a system of
      interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects,
      animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the
      ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human
      or human-to-computer interaction. IoT is a network of devices that can
      sense, accumulate and transfer data over the internet without any human
      intervention.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Simply stated, the Internet of Things consists of any device with an
      on/off switch connected to the Internet. This includes almost anything you
      can think of, ranging from cellphones to building maintenance to the jet
      engine of an airplane. Medical devices, such as a heart monitor implant or
      a biochip transponder in a farm animal, can transfer data over a network
      and are members of the IoT. If it has an off/on the switch, then it can,
      theoretically, be part of the system. The IoT consists of a gigantic
      network of internet-connected “things” and devices. Ring, a doorbell that
      links to your smartphone, provides an excellent example of a recent
      addition to the Internet of Things.
    </p>
    <h1>History of IOT</h1>
    <p class="indent">
      The Internet of Things has not been around for very long. However, there
      have been visions of machines communicating with one another since the
      early 1800s. Machines have been providing direct communications since the
      telegraph (the first landline) was developed in the 1830s and 1840s.
      Described as “wireless telegraphy,” the first radio voice transmission
      took place on June 3, 1900, providing another necessary component for
      developing the Internet of Things. The development of computers began in
      the 1950s.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      The Internet, itself a significant component of the IoT, started out as
      part of DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) in 1962 and
      evolved into ARPANET in 1969. In the 1980s, commercial service providers
      began supporting public use of ARPANET, allowing it to evolve into our
      modern Internet. Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) became a reality in
      early 1993, with the Department of Defense providing a stable, highly
      functional system of 24 satellites. This was quickly followed by privately
      owned, commercial satellites being placed in orbit. Satellites and
      landlines provide basic communications for much of the IoT. One additional
      and important component in developing a functional IoT was IPV6’s
      remarkably intelligent decision to increase address space.

    <h2>IoT- ADVANTAGES</h2>
    <p>
      <b>• Improved Customer Engagement</b> − Current analytics suffer from
      blind-spots and significant flaws inaccuracy; and as noted, engagement
      remains passive. IoT completely transforms this to achieve richer and more
      effective engagement with audiences.<br />
      <b>• Technology Optimization</b> − The same technologies and data which
      improve the customer experience also improve device use, and aid in more
      potent improvements to technology. IoT unlocks a world of critical
      functional and field data.<br />
      <b> • Reduced Waste</b> − IoT makes areas of improvement clear. Current
      analytics give us superficial insight, but IoT provides real-world
      information leading to the more effective management of resources.<br />
      <b>• Enhanced Data Collection</b> − Modern data collection suffers from
      its limitations and its design for passive use. IoT breaks it out of those
      spaces and places it exactly where humans really want to go to analyze our
      world. It allows an accurate picture of everything.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>IoT- DISADVANTAGES</h2>
    <p>
      • As the number of connected devices increases and more information is
      shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal
      confidential information also increases.<br />
      • If there’s a bug in the system, it’s likely that every connected device
      will become corrupted.<br />
      • Since there’s no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it’s
      difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with
      each other.<br />
      • Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers maybe even
      millions of IoT devices and collecting and managing the data from all
      those devices will be challenging.<br />
    </p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p class="indent">
      An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded
      processors, sensors and communication hardware to collect, send and act on
      data they acquire from their environments. IoT devices share the sensor
      data they collect by connecting to an IoT gateway or another edge device
      where data is either sent to the cloud to be analyzed or analyzed locally.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Sometimes, these devices communicate with other related devices and act on
      the information they get from one another. The devices do most of the work
      without human intervention, although people can interact with the devices.
      For instance, to set them up, give them instructions or access the data.
      The connectivity, networking and communication protocols used with these
      web-enabled devices largely depend on the specific IoT applications
      deployed.
    </p>
    <h2>Application of IoT</h2>
    <p>
      <b>• Agriculture</b> - For indoor planting, IoT makes monitoring and
      management of micro- climate conditions a reality, which in turn increases
      production. For outside planting, devices using IoT technology can sense
      soil moisture and nutrients, in conjunction with weather data, better
      control smart irrigation and fertilizer systems. If the sprinkler systems
      dispense water only when needed, for example, this prevents wasting a
      precious resource.<br />

      <b>• Consumer Use</b> - For private citizens, IoT devices in the form of
      wearables and smart homes make life easier. Wearables cover accessories
      such as Fitbit, smartphones, Apple watches, health monitors, to name a
      few. These devices improve entertainment, network connectivity, health,
      and fitness. Smart homes take care of things like activating environmental
      controls so that your house is at peak comfort when you come home. Dinner
      that requires either an oven or a crockpot can be started remotely, so the
      food is ready when you arrive. Security is made more accessible as well,
      with the consumer having the ability to control appliances and lights
      remotely, as well as activating a smart lock to allow the appropriate
      people to enter the house even if they don’t have a key.<br />

      <b>• Healthcare</b> - First and foremost, wearable IoT devices let
      hospitals monitor their patients’ health at home, thereby reducing
      hospital stays while still providing up to the minute real-time
      information that could save lives. In hospitals, smart beds keep the staff
      informed as to the availability, thereby cutting wait time for free space.
      Putting IoT sensors on critical equipment means fewer breakdowns and
      increased reliability, which can mean the difference between life and
      death. Elderly care becomes significantly more comfortable with IoT. In
      addition to the above-mentioned real-time home monitoring, sensors can
      also determine if a patient has fallen or is suffering a heart attack.<br />

      <b>• Insurance</b> - Even the insurance industry can benefit from the IoT
      revolution. Insurance companies can offer their policyholders discounts
      for IoT wearables such as Fitbit. By employing fitness tracking, the
      insurer can offer customized policies and encourage healthier habits,
      which in the long run benefits everyone, insurer, and customer alike.<br />
