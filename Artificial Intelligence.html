    <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p class="indent">
      Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power",
      or “the ability to learn and solve problems” hence Artificial Intelligence
      means "a man-made thinking power."
      <br />
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      Artificial Intelligence exists when a machine can have human-based skills
      such as learning, reasoning, and solving problems with Artificial
      Intelligence you do not need to preprogram a machine to do some work,
      despite that you can create a machine with programmed algorithms which can
      work with own intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Intelligence is composed of: <br />
      ➢ Reasoning<br />
      ➢ Learning<br />
      ➢ Problem Solving<br />
      ➢ Perception<br />
      ➢ Linguistic Intelligence<br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      An AI system is composed of an agent and its environment. An agent (e.g.,
      human or robot) is anything that can perceive its environment through
      sensors and acts upon that environment through effectors. Intelligent
      agents must be able to set goals and achieve them. In classical planning
      problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the
      world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its
      actions. However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires
      that the agent can reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that
      cannot only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate
      its predictions and adapt based on its assessment. Machine perception is
      the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones,
      sensors, etc.) to deduce aspects of the world. e.g., Computer Vision.

    <h2>Advantages of Artificiall Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      ➢ High Accuracy with fewer errors: AI machines or systems are prone to
      fewer errors and high accuracy as it takes decisions as per pre-experience
      or information.<br />
      ➢ High-Speed: AI systems can be of very high-speed and fast-decision
      making, because of that AI systems can beat a chess champion in the Chess
      game.<br />
      ➢ High reliability: AI machines are highly reliable and can perform the
      same action multiple times with high accuracy.<br />
      ➢ Useful for risky areas: AI machines can be helpful in situations such as
      defusing a bomb, exploring the ocean floor, where to employ a human can be
      risky.<br />
      ➢ Digital Assistant: AI can be very useful to provide digital assistant to
      users such as AI technology is currently used by various E-commerce
      websites to show the products as per customer requirements.<br />
      ➢ Useful as a public utility: AI can be very useful for public utilities
      such as a self-driving car which can make our journey safer and
      hassle-free, facial recognition for security purposes, Natural language
      processing (for search engines, for spelling checker, for assistant like
      Siri, for translation like google translate), etc.<br />
    </p>
    <h2>Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      ➢ High Cost: The hardware and software requirement of AI is very costly as
      it requires lots of maintenance to meet current world requirements.<br />
      ➢ Can't think out of the box: Even we are making smarter machines with AI,
      but still they cannot work out of the box, as the robot will only do that
      work for which they are trained, or programmed.<br />
      ➢ No feelings and emotions: AI machines can be an outstanding performer,
      but still it does not have the feeling so it cannot make any kind of
      emotional attachment with humans, and may sometime be harmful for users if
      the proper care is not taken.<br />
      ➢ Increase dependence on machines: With the increment of technology,
      people are getting more dependent on devices and hence they are losing
      their mental capabilities.<br />
      ➢ No Original Creativity: As humans are so creative and can imagine some
      new ideas but still AI machines cannot beat this power of human
      intelligence and cannot be creative and imaginative.<br />
